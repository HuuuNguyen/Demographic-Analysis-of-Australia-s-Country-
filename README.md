# Demographic Analysis of Australia's Country of Birth (1996 to 2016)
This Power BI dashboard project explores how Australia's population has evolved over two decades, focusing on migration-driven demographic changes. Using ABS census data (1996–2016), it visualises trends in country of birth, age structure, gender distribution, and regional settlement.

# 1. Project Overview
- **Goal:** Visualise and analyse changes in Australia's population by country of birth to support evidence-based understanding of migration trends.
- **Data Source:** Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) – Estimated Resident Population by country of birth, age, sex, and state.
- **Tool:** Power BI
- **Scope:** 10 selected countries of birth, 5 census years (1996, 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016)

# 2. Dashboards
## 2.1 National & State Trends
- Shows total population growth, ageing trends, and state-level distributions.
- Highlights NSW and VIC as dominant population centres.

## 2.2 Country of Birth Comparison
- Compares growth rates, age and gender composition, and geographic settlement of 10 migrant groups.
- Reveals high growth from Asian countries (e.g. India, China) and ageing trends in European-born groups (e.g. Italy, England).

## 2.3 Storytelling Insights
- Tracks shifting patterns in regional preference and age structure over time.
- Differentiates between Asian- and European-born migrants using growth rates, age brackets, and geographic spread.

# 3. Suggested Extensions
- Disaggregate working-age group (20–64) into narrower bands (e.g. 20–34, 35–49, 50–64) to better understand labour migration profiles.
- Cross-analyse age structure by country of birth to identify which groups drive youth vs mature workforce segments.
- Explore regional age trends (eastern vs western states) for targeted service planning.
- If available, incorporate arrival cohorts or employment data to link demographic patterns with economic impact.
